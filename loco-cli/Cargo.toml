# Enable this feature exclusively for GitHub Actions.
# The purpose behind this feature is to run tests against the fork repository url when users fork our project and open a pull request, validating the starters projects.
# When a user forks and opens a pull request from their branch, we must reference the opener's repository, not the local repository.
# Enabling this feature makes the `LOCO_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` environment variable mandatory.
