//! # Storage Module
//!
//! This module defines a generic storage abstraction represented by the
//! [`Storage`] struct. It provides methods for performing common storage
//! operations such as upload, download, delete, rename, and copy.
//!
//! ## Storage Strategy
//!
//! The [`Storage`] struct is designed to work with different storage
//! strategies. A storage strategy defines the behavior of the storage
//! operations. Strategies implement the [`strategies::StorageStrategy`].
//! The selected strategy can be dynamically changed at runtime.
