Loco is "Rust on Rails".

Loco is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you'll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you'll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

To work with Loco, you need to know Rust to a beginner-moderate level. There are no crazy lifetime twisters and most of the development will be linear: request handling, workers, tasks, etc.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ cargo install loco-cli
```

Now you can create your new app (choose "Saas app").

```sh
$ loco new
❯ App name? [myapp]:
❯ Saas app (with DB and user auth)
  Stateless service (minimal, no db)
🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp
```

<div class="infobox">
<code>loco new</code> uses SQLite by default. In production you should replace this with a more scalable database system, like Postgres.
</div>

Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:

```
$ cd myapp
$ cargo loco start
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 21.63s
    Running `target/debug/myapp start`
